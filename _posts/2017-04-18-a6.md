```
and when asked to enter file in which to save the key, type my-certificate and when asked to enter passphrase, press Enter (empty passphrase) and confirm by Enter.

This will generate my-certificate and my-certificate.pub files in the current folder

```
mv my-certificate my-certificate.pem
```

**Upload the public certificate to to server:**

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/my-certificate.pub username@ip
```
this will ask you for the password to copy the public key file contents to /home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys

```
sudo ssh -i my-certificate.pem username@ip
```

Replace the username and ip as per your configuration
