title: Glassfish Admin Password Management and Command Login without password
published: true
---


## **Introduction**

we can use the `asadmin` utility to perform administrative tasks for Oracle GlassFish Server from the command line or from a script. 

Path to the asadmin Utility

The asadmin utility is found in the glassfish installation directory

```
${glassfish_install}/bin/asadmin
asadmin> 
```

Upon running the command you enter the `asadmin>` console which enables to perform various administrative tasks

Inorder to run any command the `adadmin` utility will ask admin username and password

```
adadmin>asadmin list-applications
Enter admin user name>  admin
Enter admin password for user "admin"> 
```

The commands are executed once the username and password is validated

## **Change The admin Password**

To change the admin password run the following command

```
asadmin> change-admin-password --user admin
```

## **asadmin login without password**

If we want automated scripts to handle various administrative task we need that password need not be entered from stdin

Instead of typing the password at the command line, you can access the password for a command from a file such as `passwords.tx`t. 

The `--passwordfile` option of the `asadmin` utility takes the name of the file that contains the passwords. 

The entry for a password in the file must have the AS_ADMIN_ prefix followed by the password name in uppercase letters.

Example password file is as follows:

```
AS_ADMIN_ prefix=1234
```

For example to run deploy command via scripts we can execute

```
./asadmin deploy $war --user admin --passwordfile  /opt/password.txt
```
