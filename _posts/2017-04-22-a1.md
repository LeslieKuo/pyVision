title: Mounting NFS Share on ubuntu 16.04 Client
published: true
---

We will look at the process of mounting the network file storage on ubuntu16.04 system client

On the client server, we need to install a package called nfs-common, which provides NFS functionality without including unneeded server components. Again, we will refresh the local package index prior to installation to ensure that we have up-to-date information:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nfs-common
```

**Creating the Mount Points on the Client**

In order to make the remote shares available on the client, we need to mount the host directory on an empty client directory.

```
mkdir -p /tmp/disk2
```

**Mounting the nfs share**

```
sudo mount nfs_host:/mount /nfs/home
```

we can run `df -h` to verify that the mount is accessible

```
pi@server2:~$ df -h
