> **MBED Setup** 

###**Prerequisites**

Mbed test suite and build scripts are Python 2.7 applications and require Python 2.7 runtime environment and [setuptools](https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/setuptools.html) to install dependencies.

* Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7) programming language.
* Install [setuptools](https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/setuptools.html#installing-setuptools-and-easy-install) 
* Optionally you can install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) which is the PyPA recommended tool for installing Python packages from command line.

Mbed SDK in its repo root directory specifies `setup.py` file which holds information about all packages which are dependencies for it. 

First, clone mbed SDK repo and go to mbed SDK repo's directory:

From a command line with Git installed, run the following command in a directory where you wish mbed to be stored:

> $ git clone https://github.com/mbedmicro/mbed.git
	
Or 

> Download mbed sources https://github.com/mbedmicro/mbed

		


**Installing Tools**
	
Second, invoke ```setup.py``` so ```setuptools``` can install mbed SDK's dependencies (external Python modules required by mbed SDK):

```
$ sudo python setup.py install
```


###**Download and Install GCC ARM ToolChain**

 - Download toolchain for [gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/4.9/4.9-2015-q1-update/+download/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q1-20150306-linux.tar.bz2) 
 - Or Follow the instructions at [here](https://launchpad.net/~terry.guo/+archive/ubuntu/gcc-arm-embedded)

For example, if you want to change the path to your GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors to a path like `c:/arm_gcc/bin`, you simply need to have a `workspace_tools/private_settings.py` that contains following line:

	> GCC_ARM_PATH = "c:/arm_gcc/bin"


### **Workspace tools**

Workspace tools are set of Python scripts used off-line by Mbed SDK team to:

* Compile and build mbed SDK,
* Compile and build libraries included in mbed SDK repo like e.g. ETH (Ethernet), USB, RTOS or CMSIS,
* Compile, build and run mbed SDK tests,
* Run test regression locally and in CI server,
* Get library, target, test configuration (paths, parameters, names etc.).

### **Configure workspace tools to work with your compilers**

we need to tell workspace tools where our compilers are.

* Go ```mbed/workspace_tools/``` directory and create empty file called ```private_settings.py```.
 
```
$ touch private_settings.py
```

* Populate this file the Python code below: 

```python
from os.path import join
 
# ARMCC
ARM_PATH = "C:/Work/toolchains/ARMCompiler_5.03_117_Windows"
ARM_BIN = join(ARM_PATH, "bin")
ARM_INC = join(ARM_PATH, "include")
ARM_LIB = join(ARM_PATH, "lib")
 
ARM_CPPLIB = join(ARM_LIB, "cpplib")
MY_ARM_CLIB = join(ARM_PATH, "lib", "microlib")
 
# GCC ARM
GCC_ARM_PATH = "C:/Work/toolchains/gcc_arm_4_8/4_8_2013q4/bin"
 
# GCC CodeSourcery
GCC_CS_PATH = "C:/Work/toolchains/Sourcery_CodeBench_Lite_for_ARM_EABI/bin"
 
# GCC CodeRed
GCC_CR_PATH = "C:/Work/toolchains/LPCXpresso_6.1.4_194/lpcxpresso/tools/bin"
 
# IAR
IAR_PATH = "C:/Work/toolchains/iar_6_5/arm"
 
SERVER_ADDRESS = "127.0.0.1"
LOCALHOST = "127.0.0.1"
 
# This is moved to separate JSON configuration file used by singletest.py
MUTs = {
}
```

Replace corresponding variable values with paths to compilers installed in your system:

* ```ARM_PATH``` for armcc compiler.
* ```GCC_ARM_PATH``` for GCC ARM compiler.
* ```GCC_CS_PATH``` for GCC CodeSourcery compiler.
* ```GCC_CR_PATH``` for GCC CodeRed compiler.
* ```IAR_PATH``` for IAR compiler. 

Workspace tools will use compiler's path variable only if you explicit ask for it from command line. You need to replace only paths for your installed compilers.

Note: Settings in ```private_settings.py``` will overwrite variables with default values in ```mbed/workspace_tools/settings.py``` file.


###**Build System**

The mbed build system is composed of two scripts:

- workspace_tools/build.py to build the libraries
- workspace_tools/make.py to build and run the test projects

Both share a subset of options to specify the target microcontroller and the toolchain:

> -m MCU -t TOOLCHAIN

If, for example, you want to build the mbed library for the LPC1768 mbed using the ARM GCC toolchain:

> python workspace_tools\build.py -m LPC1768 -t GCC_ARM

If you want to compile source files then issue the command in the root of 
project directory

> python workspace_tools\make.py -m LPC1768 -t GCC_ARM


## **build.py script**

It is the core script  to drive compilation, linking and building process for:

* mbed SDK (with libs like Ethernet, RTOS, USB, USB host).
* Tests which also can be linked with libraries like RTOS or Ethernet.

`Build.py` script is a powerful tool to build mbed SDK for all available platforms using all supported by mbed cross-compilers. S

```
$ python build.py --help
```

*  The command line parameter ```-m``` specifies the ```MCUs/platforms ```for which you want to build the mbed SDK. More than one MCU(s)/platform(s) may be specified with this parameter using comma as delimiter.

	Example for one platform build:

	```
	$ python build.py -m NUCLEO_F334R8 -t GCC_ARM
	```

	or for many platforms:

	```
	$ python build.py -m NUCLEO_F303RE,NUCLEO_F334R8 -t GCC_ARM
	```

*  Parameter ```-t``` defined which `toolchain` should be used for mbed SDK build. You can build Mbed SDK for multiple toolchains using one command. 

* Below example will compile mbed SDK for Freescale Freedom KL25Z platform using ARM and GCC_ARM compilers:

	```
	$ python build.py -m NUCLEO_F334R8 -t ARM,GCC_ARM
	```

* You can combine this technique to compile multiple targets with multiple compilers.
```
$ python build.py -m NUCLEO_F303RE,NUCLEO_F334R8 -t GCC_ARM,ARM
```

* Building libraries included in mbed SDK's source code. Parameters ```-r```, ```-e```, ```-u```, ```-U```, ```-d```, ```-b``` will add ```RTOS```, ```Ethernet```, ```USB```, ```USB Host```, ```DSP```, ```U-Blox``` libraries respectively. 

	Example

	```
	$ python build.py -m LPC1768 -t ARM -r -e
	```

* You can be more verbose ```-v``` especially if you want to see each compilation / linking command build.py is executing:

	```
	$ python build.py -t GCC_ARM -m LPC1768 -j 8 -v
	```


## **Build Mbed SDK library from sources**

Now we look at how to compile the MBED SDK from sources using ```build.py```  workspace tools script.

Go to the 

```mbed/workspace_tools/``` directory  and type the following command to start the MBED SDK build for [LPC1768](http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/) platform using ARM compiler.

```
$ python build.py -m LPC1768 -t GCC_ARM - j 4
```

For multi-threaded compilation please use option ```-j X``` where ```X``` is number of cores you want to use to compile mbed SDK. 

 
We can see for a new directory ```TARGET_LPC1768``` was created in 
 ```build/mbed``` directory which contains all the build primitives.

 ```build/mbed``` directory contains all the generic MBED header files which are required for user defined project while  ```build/mbed/TARGET_LPC1768/``` contains platform dependent header files required by user defined projects.

 ```build/mbed/TARGET_LPC1768/TOOLCHAIN_GCC_ARM``` contains mbed SDK library ```libmbed.a``` 

Workspace tools track changes in source code and  ```build.py``` script will recompile project with all dependencies in case of changes .


## **make.py script**

```make.py``` is a ```mbed/workspace_tools/``` script used to build user defined projects

The ```make.py``` script depends on existing already built mbed SDK and library sources so you need to pre-build mbed SDK and other libraries (such as RTOS library) to link user defined projects with mbed SDK and other mbed library. To pre-build mbed SDK please use ```build.py``` script.

`make.py` shares  same  subset of options as `build.py` to specify the target microcontroller and the toolchain:


### **Directory Structure for User Defined Project **

|---mbed
|--- workspace---src---project---Makefile
|--- workspace---src---project---src
|--- workpace---src---project---Readme.md

###**Makefile**

<pre class="python">

DIRNAME=$(shell basename $(realpath ./))
MAKEFILE_PATH=$(realpath ../../../mbed/workspace_tools/make.py)
BUILD_DIR=$(realpath ../../build/)
SOURCE_PATH=$(realpath ./)
BUILD_PATH=$(BUILD_DIR)/$(DIRNAME)
MCU=NUCLEO_F334R8 #board or build profile name
TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM # tool chain
FLAGS="-D__STM__ -Wswitch"
all:
        $(MAKEFILE_PATH) --source=$(SOURCE_PATH) --build=$(BUILD_PATH) -m $(MCU) -t $(TOOLCHAIN) $(FLAGS) 

clean:
        rm -r $(BUILD_PATH)

help:
        $(MAKEFILE_PATH) --help

</pre>

To get started with a  new project,simple create a new sub directory in `workspace` and copy the Makefile  ,and execute make to compile the project

```
$ make 
```

Modify the  `FLAGS` variable in the `Makefile` to include command line options for including MBED libraries or other compilation options
