title: Partitioning and Mounting disk on Ubuntu 16.04 using fdisk and gparted
published: true
---

The `fdisk` command is a text-based utility for viewing and managing hard disk partitions on Linux. It’s one of the most powerful tools you can use to manage partitions.


Many drives come with a single partition already set up, but all storage devices are just treated as a mass of unallocated, free space when they contain no partitions. To actually set up a file system and save any files to the drive, the drive needs a partition.

Partitions are necessary because you can’t just start writing files to a blank drive. You must first create at least one container with a file system. After creating a partition, the partition is formatted with a file system — like the NTFS file system on Windows drives, FAT32 file system for removable drives, HFS+ file system on Mac computers, or the ext4 file system on Linux. Files are then written to that file system on the partition.

The sudo fdisk -l commands lists the partitions on your system.

```
sudo fdisk -l

Disk /dev/xvda: 100 GiB, 107374182400 bytes, 209715200 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x974bb19a

Device     Boot  Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/xvda1 *      2048    526335    524288  256M 83 Linux
/dev/xvda2      526336 209715166 209188831 99.8G 83 Linux


Disk /dev/xvdc: 100 GiB, 107374182400 bytes, 209715200 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

```

This shows that the disk `/dev/xvda1` has already been partitioned and contains 2 partitions
one a boot partition `/dev/xvda1` of 256MB and another linux parition `/dev/xvda2` of 99.8G

The disk `/dev/xvdc` does not contain any partitions

To create a partition we need to enter command mode
we do this by typing the command

```
root@server2:/home/pi# sudo fdisk /dev/xvdc

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.27.1).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

Device does not contain a recognized partition table.
Created a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0xeb288d63.

Command (m for help): 

```

As seen we can see that since the device is not partitioned ,it does not contain any partition table

Use the option `p` to print the current partition table

```
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/xvdc: 100 GiB, 107374182400 bytes, 209715200 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0xeb288d63

Command (m for help): 

```



When partitioning, you’ll need to be aware of the difference between primary, extended, and logical partitions. A disk with a traditional partition table can only have up to four partitions. Extended and logical partitions are a way to get around this limitation.

Each disk can have up to four primary partitions or three primary partitions and an extended partition. If you need four partitions or less, you can just create them as primary partitions.

However, let’s say you want six partitions on a single drive. You’d have to create three primary partitions as well as an extended partition. The extended partition effectively functions as a container that allows you to create a larger amount of logical partitions. 
So, if you needed six partitions, you’d create three primary partitions, an extended partition, and then three logical partitions inside the extended partition.  You could also just create a single primary partition, an extended partition, and five logical partitions — you just can’t have more than four primary partitions at a time.

The `n command` can be used to create a new partition.

- You can create a logical or primary partition (l for logical or p for primary). A disk can only have four primary partitions.
- Next, specify the sector of the disk you want the partition to start at. Press Enter to accept the default sector, which is the first free sector on the disk.
- Last, specify the last sector of the partition on the disk. If you want to use up all available space after the initial sector, just press Enter

```
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/xvdc: 100 GiB, 107374182400 bytes, 209715200 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0xeb288d63

Command (m for help): n
Partition type
   p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
   e   extended (container for logical partitions)
Select (default p): 

Using default response p.
Partition number (1-4, default 1): 
First sector (2048-209715199, default 2048): 
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-209715199, default 209715199): 

Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 100 GiB.

```

we can see that by running the `p` command again that linux partition of 100G space have been created
on the `/dev/xvdc` device

```
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/xvdc: 100 GiB, 107374182400 bytes, 209715200 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0xeb288d63

Device     Boot Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/xvdc1       2048 209715199 209713152  100G 83 Linux
```



Use w to write the changes you’ve made to disk.

```
Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered.
Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
Syncing disks.
```

**Formatting a Partition**

You must format new partitions with a file system before you can use them. You can do this with the appropriate mkfs command.

we will be formatting the partition as ext4 file system.

```
root@server2:/home/pi# sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdc1 
mke2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
Creating filesystem with 26214144 4k blocks and 6553600 inodes
Filesystem UUID: 6aef433c-583d-4fd4-9e2b-33084414a4bd
Superblock backups stored on blocks: 
	32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208, 
	4096000, 7962624, 11239424, 20480000, 23887872

Allocating group tables: done                            
Writing inode tables: done                            
Creating journal (32768 blocks): done

Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done  
```

We can also configure partitions using `gparted` which is a graphical utility

**Launch the utility**

![](http://34.194.184.172/emotix/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/f21-1.png)

**Create Parition Table**

create parition Table by selecting option "Device->New Partition Table" and selecting the default options

![](http://34.194.184.172/emotix/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/f23.png)

**Create and Format the partition **

Right Click on the unallocated partition and Select New to enter the menu to create and format the new partition

![](http://34.194.184.172/emotix/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/f27.png)

Enter the parition size ,whether its a primary or extended partition and filesystem type

![](http://34.194.184.172/emotix/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/f28.png)

Upon selecting the Add options,It will create the respective parition and also format it as per selected options

![](http://34.194.184.172/emotix/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/f29.png)


**Mount the parition**

we can now mount the partition and start using it.

```
mount /dev/xvdc1 /tmp/storage1
```

If the computer is rebooted then we need to manually run the mount command

To configure the system to auto mount the system we need to edit the `/etc/fstab` file
however icorrectly editing the files can lead to destructive changes,hence it is
better to use a graphical or commandline utility which edits the file

we will be using `gnome-disks` utility

```
sudo apt-get install gnome-disk-utility`
sudo gnome-disks
```

**Launch the utility**

![](http://34.194.184.172/emotix/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/f12.png)

**Edit and save the mount options**

![](http://34.194.184.172/emotix/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/f14.png)

![](http://34.194.184.172/emotix/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/f16.png)


Once the configuration is done we can see the following entry added in the `/etc/fstab` file

```
/dev/disk/by-uuid/6aef433c-583d-4fd4-9e2b-33084414a4bd /opt/miko/storage/disk1 auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0
```

Now you can restart the compute and see that all the partitions are auto mounted.
