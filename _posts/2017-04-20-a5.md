# **Introduction**

Configuration management systems are designed to make controlling large numbers of servers in easy for administrators and operations teams. They allow you to control many systems from one central location using automated way.

Ansible works by configuring client machines from an computer with Ansible components installed and configured.
Any server that has an SSH port exposed can configured by Ansible.Ansible can interact with clients through either command line tools or through its configuration scripts called Playbooks.

## **Step 1 â€” Installing Ansible**

Run the following commands to run ansible

```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible
```

## ** Step 2 - Configuring Ansible Hosts**

ansible keeps track of the servers it controlls through a host/inventory files.The host/inventory file can be found at `/etc/ansible/hosts`

Syntax of the host file is as follows

```
[group_name]
alias ansible_ssh_host=your_server_ip
```

The group_name is an organizational tag that lets you refer to any servers listed under it with one word. The alias is just a name to refer to that server.

For example

```
[dev]
beta_server ansible_ssh_host=192.0.2.1
```

If the ssh is not running on the default port

```
[dev]
beta_server ansible_port=5555 ansible_host=192.0.2.50
```

We can also specify ssh user

```
[dev]
beta_server ansible_port=5555 ansible_host=192.0.2.50 ansible_user=root
```

To add a lot of hosts  we can also specify patterns

```
[webservers]
www[01:50].example.com
```

Hosts can be in multiple groups and groups can configure parameters for all of their members.

There are a host of other options like `ansible_ssh_private_key_file`,`ansible_ssh_pass`,`ansible_become` which can be found at
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html#hosts-and-groups

**Host Variables**

The `host_vars` directory can be used to store host variables that can later be used in configuration scripts `ansible playbooks`

To create a host file for `beta_server`
```
mkdir /etc/ansible/host_vars
sudo vi /etc/ansible/host_vars/beta_server
```

you can place the configuration parameters in this file

```
---
ansible_ssh_user:  root
ansible_port: 5555 
ansible_host: 192.0.2.50
```

Similariy we can set configuration parameters for group by using group variables

```
sudo mkdir /etc/ansible/group_vars
sudo nano /etc/ansible/group_vars/dev
```

Since ansible connects to client machine via ssh . It requires information regarding ssh user and password on the client machine

We can configure ansible to user a specific user for all the servers in the dev group


The contents of the file are

```
---
ansible_ssh_user:  root
ansible_port: 5555 
ansible_host: 192.0.2.50
```

Instead of creating files,you can create directories named after group or hosts and ansible will read all the files within the directory


Now let us assume you have ssh private key which enables you to take ssh sessions on respective server

```
ssh -i access_key.pem user@hostname
```

For steps to create the private key refer to the following link

Let us configure the host variables for the beta server by creating `sh_config` file in the directory `/etc/ansible/host_vars/dev2`

```
---

ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /etc/ansible/a.pem
ansible_host: 172.17.0.2
ansible_port: 22
ansible_ssh_user: root
```

Following is the entry in the `/etc/ansible/hosts` file

```
[dev-servers]
dev2
```

To test the communication with the client run the command

```
root@pi-dektop:/home/pi/ansible# ansible -m ping dev2
dev2 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
```
