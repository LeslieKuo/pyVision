title: Sudo Permissions to a script on ubuntu 14.04
published: true
---



The sudoers file located at: `/etc/sudoers`, contains the rules that users must follow when using the sudo command.

The `/etc/sudoers` file controls who can run what commands as what users on what machines and can also control special things such as whether you need a password for particular commands. The file is composed of aliases (basically variables) and user specifications (which control who can run what).

`visudo` is utility to edit the `/etc/sudoers` file which enable us to configure permissions 

**User Specifications**

User Specifications are where the sudoers file sets who can run what as who.

Format for user specification is as follows
```
<user list> <host list> = <operator list> <tag list> <command list>
```

Let is consider the following configuration 

```
pi ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

This allows user `pi` to run any command as root user and it will not prompt for password from the user

```
beta-dev ALL=(root) /opt/test.ksh
```

This allows beta-dev users run the ` /opt/test.ksh` script giving root access for script execution

```
beta-dev ALL=(root) NOPASSWD /opt/test.ksh
```

This allows beta-dev users run the ` /opt/test.ksh` script giving root access for script execution
and this will not ask for a password from the user
