**Install R Packages**

Let consider the installation of Knowledge Space Theory `kst` package. 

**Renviron File**
First we create a file .Renviron in our home area

Add the line `R_LIBS=/data/Rpackages/` to it. 

This means that whenever you start R, the directory `/data/Rpackages/` is added to the list of places to look for R packages and so:

**CommandLine Installation **
We just fire up an R shell and type:

> install.packages("kst")

or you can explicitly pass installation path 

> install.packages("kst", lib="/data/Rpackages/")
> library(kst, lib.loc="/data/Rpackage=s/")

The installation can also be done using GUI of RStudio by selecting the option `Tools->Install Packages`
