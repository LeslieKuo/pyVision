This article describes on how to add a user defined library in MBED

> Adding User Defined Library to MBED 

Following files need to be changed to add support for new libraries in mbed

we will be defining a new library called `kfactory`

- build.py - main build file
- libraries.py - files containing info on various libraries and build paths
- path.py - files containing path definitions for various libraries

Adding the paths for `kfactory` source and build diretory in the `path.py` file

```
 #kfactory libraries
KFACTORY=join(LIB_DIR,"kfactory")
KFACTORY_LIBRARIES=join(BUILD_DIR,"kfactory");
```

This configures the build directory for `kfactory` library

Defining the source,build directories and dependent libraries in library configuration file `libraries.py`

```
    {
        "id": "kfactory",
        "source_dir": KFACTORY,
        "build_dir": KFACTORY_LIBRARIES,
        "dependencies": [MBED_LIBRARIES,RTOS_LIBRARIES],
    },
```

This adds the library dependencies for kfactory library

Adding the new library in build command line parser in the file `build.py`

```
    parser.add_option("-k", "--kfactory",
                      action="store_true",
                      dest="kfactory",
                      default=False,
                      help="Compile the kfactory library")
```

This add a new command line argument `-k` for compilation of kfactory library

Now place the library source files in `mbed/libraries/kfactory` subdirectory

To trigger the build run the command

```
$ python build.py -t GCC_ARK -m NUCLEO_F334R8 -k
```

the `-k` option has been added for compiling the new library
