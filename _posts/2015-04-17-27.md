### Installing Git Subtree From Sources

Git subtree is a git helper to combine and manage multiple repos in one project.

This article describes how to install git subtree on Ubuntu 12.04 OS.

Since subtree is mostly collection of shell scripts  and was introduced in moved to contrib package as part git version `1.7.9.11`.The latest version of git available from standard sources on Ubuntu 12.04 is `1.7.9.5`.Hence we will build and install the latest version of git from sources

### Dependencies
Prior to installing git we need to install some dependencies

<pre class="brush:python">

sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev gettext libz-dev libssl-dev build-essential


</pre>

### Compile Git Modules

Get the git sources from [enter link description here](https://github.com/git/git)

<pre class="brush:python">

make prefix=/usr/ all

</pre>

### Install Git

If you want to do a global install, install it once as yourself and once as root, using the sudo prefix:
<pre class="brush:python">

sudo make prefix=/usr/ install

</pre>

### Compile and Install git contrib

- Go into the `git/contrib/subtree` directory
- Build and install git subtree 
<pre class="brush:python">

make
sudo make prefix=/usr install

</pre>

### Configure a subtree

We have created a repository called `root`
we will configure the git respository  `adroid` as subtree in `root` repository

<pre class="brush:python">

git remote add adroid git@github.com:pyVision/adroid.git
git subtree add —-prefix=adroid/ adroid master

</pre>

- First the repository of sub-directory is added as remote of the present repository 

- The git subtree add command tells git to add that repo’s code into a path in the parent’s project, specified by prefix in this case `adroid` .The last prefix `master` is the branch you are pulling code from.
