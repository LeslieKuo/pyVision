**ANTLR installation and usage on ubuntu 14.04**
=====

In this article we will look at installation and usage of ANTLRsoftware

ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. 

**Download**
------------

Antlr repository can be downloaded by running the below commands

```
git clone https://github.com/antlr/antlr4.git
```


**Pre Requisites**

Antlr requires `Apache maven` build manager for Java projects.

```
sudo apt-get install maven maven2
```

python 3.5

- Download the source files from 

```
https://www.python.org/downloads/source/
```	
- build and install python 3.5

```
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

**Compile**

Antlr can be compiled by executing the below command

```
mvn compile
mvn install
```

This will deploy antlr in the default location

```
~/.m2/repository
```

The main antlr jar files is located at

```
~/.m2/repository/org/antlr/antlr4/4.5/antlr4-4.5.jar
```

to use this we need to set classpath as follows

```
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:~/.m2/repository/org/antlr/antlr4/4.5/antlr4-4.5.jar
```

**Execution**

Put the following grammar inside file `Hello.g4`

```
// Define a grammar called Hello
grammar Hello;
r  : 'hello' ID ;         // match keyword hello followed by an identifier
ID : [a-z]+ ;             // match lower-case identifiers
WS : [ \t\r\n]+ -> skip ; // skip spaces, tabs, newlines
```

Then run ANTLR the tool on it:

```
$ alias antlr4='java -Xmx500M -cp "~/.m2/repository/org/antlr/antlr4/4.5/antlr4-4.5.jar:$CLASSPATH" org.antlr.v4.Tool'

$ alias grun='java org.antlr.v4.runtime.misc.TestRig'

$ antlr4 Hello.g4
$ javac Hello*.java
```

To test it run the following command

```
$ grun Hello r -tree input.txt
```

contents of `input.txt` file is `hello world`

This will give a GUI with parse tree displayed in the output

That pops up a dialog box showing that rule `r` matched keyword `hello` followed by identifier `parrt`.
