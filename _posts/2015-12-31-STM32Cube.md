**STM32 Cube Download**

STMCube™ is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease developers’ life by reducing development efforts, time and cost. STM32Cube covers STM32 portfolio.

STM32Cube includes the STM32CubeMX which is a graphical software configuration tool that allows generating C initialization code using graphical wizards.

It also comprises the `STM32CubeF0` platform which includes the `STM32Cube HAL` (an STM32 abstraction layer embedded software, ensuring maximized portability across STM32 portfolio), plus a consistent set of middleware components (RTOS, USB, FatFS and STM32 touch sensing). All embedded software utilities come with a full set of examples.

`STM32CubeF0 `gathers in one single package all the generic embedded software components required to develop an application on STM32F0 microcontrollers. Following STM32Cube initiative, this set of components is highly portable, not only within STM32F0 series but also to other STM32 series.

`STM32CubeF0` is fully compatible with `STM32CubeMX` code generator that allows generating initialization code. The package includes a low level hardware abstraction layer (HAL) that covers the microcontroller hardware, together with an extensive set of examples running on STMicroelectronics boards. The HAL is available in open-source BSD license for user convenience.
