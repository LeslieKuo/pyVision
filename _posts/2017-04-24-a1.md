published: true
---


asciinema is a lightweight, purely text-based approach to terminal recording.

To install `asciinema` on ubuntu 16.04 run the following command

```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:zanchey/asciinema
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install asciinema
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
```

**Start Recording**

By running asciinema rec [filename] you start a new recording session

```
root@b3c403d0dff1:/# asciinema rec test1
~ Asciicast recording started.
~ Hit Ctrl-D or type "exit" to finish.
# ls
bin  boot  dev	etc  home  lib	lib32  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run	sbin  srv  sys	test1  tmp  usr  var
# ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
  484 pts/0    00:00:00 sh
  485 pts/0    00:00:00 sh
  487 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
# exit
~ Asciicast recording finished.

```

**Playback Recording**

you can playback the recording

```
root@b3c403d0dff1:/# asciinema play test1
# ls
bin  boot  dev	etc  home  lib	lib32  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run	sbin  srv  sys	test1  tmp  usr  var
# ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
  484 pts/0    00:00:00 sh
  485 pts/0    00:00:00 sh
  487 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
# exit
root@b3c403d0dff1:/# 

```

We can see that play command replayed the command and also the corresponding output from the test1 file

The output of recording is a json file which keeps on storing the command and corresponding output
